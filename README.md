This repository includes a Max/MSP patch designed to interact with the velocity levels of sounds. The patch activates the microphone to capture sounds and is configured with a specific threshold (adjustable). The live camera projects the video on the screen in black and white. When the sound levels exceed a specified threshold, the video transitions to color, and with varying velocity, the colors change dynamically.
